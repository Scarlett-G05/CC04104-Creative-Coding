The three projects I chose to create were:
Project 1: A real time audio visualiser, with 4 different effects
[**Project 1**] (sketch.js)
Project 2: A mouse-driven painting tool with 4 different 'brush' tools 
[**Project 2**] (main-paint.js)
Project 3: A one key game (two players) with a clear win state 
[**Project 3**] (main_game.js)
